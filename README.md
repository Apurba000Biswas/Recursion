# Recursion
Solving a problem using recursion depends on solving smaller occurences of the same problem
##### Key question : "How is this problem self-similiar?"

### Example: Double the M&M bowl
  - We Need Double the M&M candies in a large bowl
  - We dont know exactly how many are in the bowl
  - We are not able to count, but many of us can work together
  - How do we do it?
